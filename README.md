# 📟 Fun Calculator - README 🎉

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This lightweight Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers. With playful comments and emoji flair, it makes simple math operations more enjoyable! 😊

## ✨ Features
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division
- 🎨 Fun emoji-enhanced output
- ⚠️ Basic error handling (though division by zero isn't fully protected - be careful!)

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
1. Save the script as `fun_calculator.py`
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Run: `python fun_calculator.py`
4. Enter two numbers when prompted
5. Enjoy your math results! 🎉

## 📝 Example Usage
```bash
$ python fun_calculator.py
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0 ➕
Difference: 8.0 ➖
Product: 20.0 ✖️
Quotient: 5.0 ➗
```

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Currently doesn't handle division by zero gracefully (try not to break math! 😅)
- Only works with two numbers at a time

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add more operations (exponents, modulo, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling
- Create a GUI version
- Allow multiple number inputs
